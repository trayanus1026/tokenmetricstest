What this mirrors in the job:
You will build the mobile investor experience for Token Metrics vaults. This mirrors:
React Native development with Web3 integration
Privy wallet connection and transaction signing
Handling blockchain states (pending, confirmed, failed) in mobile UI
Building for iOS and Android simultaneously

Goal:
Build a React Native (Expo) app that connects a wallet, displays vault data, and completes an Approve → Deposit flow.
Core Scope:
1. Wallet connection (Privy or WalletConnect)
"Connect Wallet" button
Display connected address (truncated)
Display USDC balance
Persist connection across app restarts

2. Vault display
Show 3 vault cards: Stable, Growth, Turbo
Each card shows:
Name and risk level indicator
Target APY range
User's current balance (if any)
TVL

3. Deposit flow
Amount input with quick buttons (25%, 50%, 75%, MAX)
Show estimated shares to receive
Approve → Deposit transaction sequence
Loading states with haptic feedback
Success state with confetti animation
Error handling (user reject, tx revert, insufficient funds)

4. Network handling
Detect wrong network
Prompt switch to HyperEVM (or testnet)
Clear error if user stays on wrong network

5. Portfolio view
Show user's positions across all vaults
Total USD value
Individual vault breakdown

Tech Requirements:
Expo or bare React Native
ethers.js or viem for Web3
nativewind or StyleSheet for styling
Must run on iOS simulator

High-Signal Checkpoints:
How you handle the async nature of blockchain transactions in mobile UI
Error states and edge cases, not just happy path
Whether the app feels native (not a web wrapper)

Stretch Scope:
Withdraw flow: Including pending state for locked funds
Pull-to-refresh: Reload balances
Transaction history: Show recent deposits/withdrawals from events
TestFlight build: Provide a TestFlight link we can install
